## About the Role
We are seeking a highly motivated and experienced Senior Backend Engineer to join our team. In this role, you will be instrumental in evolving our critical backend-for-frontend (BFF) application, built in Golang. This application serves as a crucial layer, providing controlled and secure access to logging data stored across major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and enabling essential self-service capabilities for our users.

You will leverage your expertise in cloud technologies, backend development, and DevOps practices to drive the development, deployment, and operational excellence of this application. This is a high-impact position where you will have the opportunity to shape technical direction, implement best practices, and contribute significantly to our platform's success.

## Responsibilities
- Design, develop, and maintain the Golang backend application, focusing on secure and efficient access to object storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage) across multiple cloud providers.
- Implement and enhance self-service features, including managing permissions, updating lifecycle policies, and configuring notification integrations with cloud queue services (SQS, Pub/Sub, Azure Service Bus).
- Integrate and maintain robust authentication and authorization mechanisms using OAuth2 and OIDC protocols, working with our Identity Provider (CyberArk).
- Manage the full application lifecycle on AWS Fargate, including deployment automation, scaling, and monitoring.
- Develop and maintain Infrastructure as Code using Terraform to provision and manage cloud resources.
- Implement and manage secrets within Hashicorp Vault for secure credential management.
- Design, build, and maintain CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment using GitHub Enterprise and other relevant tools.
- Establish and enforce Git branching strategies and workflows to facilitate collaborative development.
- Mentor and guide fellow engineers on best practices in backend development, cloud interactions, and code collaboration.
- Create and maintain technical documentation covering application architecture, development practices, deployment procedures, and user onboarding (including IdP setup).
- Proactively identify and address technical challenges, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities.
- Collaborate with frontend engineers, product managers, and other stakeholders to define requirements and deliver high-quality solutions.

## Required Qualifications
- Proven experience as a backend engineer with significant experience in Golang.
- Strong understanding of building and consuming RESTful APIs.
- Hands-on experience with at least one major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure), with a preference for experience across multiple providers.
- Experience working with object storage services (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage).
- Solid understanding of authentication and authorization concepts, including OAuth2 and OIDC.
- Experience with deploying and managing applications on container orchestration platforms like AWS Fargate (or Kubernetes).
- Proficiency in Infrastructure as Code tools, specifically Terraform.
- Experience with CI/CD pipeline development and management.
- Familiarity with Git and collaborative development workflows (e.g., Pull Requests).
- Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently and figure out technical solutions with minimal direction.
- Strong communication skills and the ability to create clear and concise technical documentation.

## Bonus Qualifications
- Experience with Hashicorp Vault.
- Experience with queueing services (SQS, Pub/Sub, Azure Service Bus).
- Familiarity with Identity Providers (IdPs) like CyberArk.
- Experience in a backend-for-frontend (BFF) architecture.
- Experience establishing development practices and contributing to team collaboration improvements.
